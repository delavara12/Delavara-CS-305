## Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

For this project we were tasked to assist Artemis Financial in ensuring proper security for there application. They wanted to make sure there security was up to date and that they had the proper HTTPS protocol to ensure they were using secure connections. 

## What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

For me, i felt that I was able to get through the vulnerablities very well and able to find the correct algorithm that best suited the companys needs. It is important because there are malicious cyber attackers that look into bringing your stuff down. The way I see it is that the more of an importance the project is the higher chance that someone will attempt hacking it. It helps protect all the data and information stored with in it. The values it adds, in this case, it provides security to all the members in this database. I gives you the sense of security knowing that people cant just break in and still all the critical information within.

## What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

I found that finding the false positives were the biggest challenges. At times I was worried that I was supressing the wrong vulnerability. My goal and mindset was that if i was unsure about a certian vulnerability I would not surpress it. But it was great to get that experiance of sifting through the false positives and the actual vulnerabilities. 

## How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

I made to find the right algorithms to makes sure that the data was secure. I used the java keytool with rsa algorithm to creat a private and public keys and implemented them into the application. In the furue I will continue to use dependency checker and make sure that the dependencies are up to date. Lastly, will will make sure that I am using HTTPS to ensure secure connection to the server.

## How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I compiled the code and check for any errors. If any were present I would fix them accordingly. After that I would run the Maven dependency check to view any vilnerabilities present. Everytime I used it the dependency version would need updating. 

## What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Understanding how Maven works. Getting used to the POM files, I would also say that the springframe work would be a big thing to get used to and proficiant in. I would also say that understanding why creating a  self signed CA and implementing that.  

## Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I would say that this project showcases my understanding of secure coding, creating encryption keys and understanding the different algorithms.
